# Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains 6 programs:
* `chi-square.py`: calculates the [chi square goodness of fit test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) on given datasets
* `k-means.py`:  divides the given data points into a given amount of clusters using the [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm
* `silhouette.py`: calculates the optimal number of clusters for [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) for the given dataset using the [silhouette algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering))
* `plotter.py`: generates the following plots from the two given datasets: distribution of colors in both sets and the difference in those distributions
* `tn.py`: ???

### Requirements
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is required by all of the programs. It is assumed that the user has access to a [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) or can run and give command line arguments to Python programs by other means. Some additional third-party libraries are also required by some of the programs. Details are provided in each program's own subsection



## Programs
The following sections will describe the requirements, usage, and functionality of these programs.

### chi-square.py
Calculates the chi-square value of the given subset compared to the other given dataset.

#### Requirements
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) if one wishes to plot the data in a 3d plot


#### Usage
    $ python3 chi-square.py SUBSET DATA
where `SUBSET` is a path to a JSON file containing data of a certain subset of the whole data, and `DATA` is a path to a JSON file containing the whole data (to which the subset is compared to).


#### How it works
The chi-square algorithm is described on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit#Pearson's_chi-squared_test). In the case of our study, we divided the RGB-colorspace into 8 smaller congruent cubes, each corresponding to a studied color (i.e. a 6-bit color). The number of cubes can be changed by changing the variable `n` in the code: the cube will be divided into `n`Â³ cubes.



### k-means.py
Divides the data into a given amount of clusters using the [k-means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

#### Requirements
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


#### Usage
    $ python3 k-means.py DATA N
where `DATA` is the path to a JSON file containing the dataset, and `N` is the cluster amount.


#### How it works
The program uses scikit-learn's k-means algorithm to cluster the data and then plots it using matplotlib.



### silhouette.py
Calculates the optimal number of clusters to divide the data to using the [silhouette algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) and divides the data into that many clusters using the [k-means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

#### Requirements
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


#### Usage
    $ python3 silhouette.py DATA N
where `DATA` is the path to a JSON file containing the dataset, and `N` is the maximum cluster amount to be tested.


#### How it works
For each cluster amount from 2 to the given maximum cluster count the silhouette score is calculated and the scores logged. Then the cluster count with the best score logged and the k-means clustering plotted in a 3d plot.
